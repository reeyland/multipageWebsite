	<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
	<p>This is one of the best Anime I have ever watched. Howl's Moving Castle is a Japanese animated film released in 2004. This animated film, directed by Hayao Mizaki, is the result of an adaptation of a novel with the same title by Diana Wyne. Howls Moving Castle tells the story of an 18-year-old hat-making girl named Shopie. Sophie (Emily Mortimer) has an uneventful life at her late father's hat shop, but all that changes when she befriends wizard Howl (Christian Bale), who lives in a magical flying castle. However, the evil Witch of Waste (Lauren Bacall) takes issue with their budding relationship and casts a spell on young Sophie, which ages her prematurely. Now Howl must use all his magical talents to battle the jealous hag and return Sophie to her former youth and beauty.</p>

	<h3>Arrietty</h3>
	<p>arrietty is the first movie that made me fall in love with anime. it has a unique story, making me interested in every second scene in the movie. Arrietty, a tiny teenager, lives with her parents in the recesses of a suburban home, unbeknown to the homeowner and housekeeper. Like others of her kind, Arrietty remains hidden from her human hosts, but occasionally ventures forth from beneath the floorboards to borrow sugar cubes and other supplies. A secret friendship forms when 12-year-old Shawn meets Arrietty, but their relationship could spell danger for Arrietty's family.</p>

	<h3>Your Name</h3>
	<p>your name is one of the movies that must be watched at least once in a lifetime. with a deep message, this movie drains a lot of tears from its viewers including me. Two teenagers share a profound, magical connection upon discovering they are swapping bodies. Things manage to become even more complicated when the boy and girl decide to meet in person.</p>
